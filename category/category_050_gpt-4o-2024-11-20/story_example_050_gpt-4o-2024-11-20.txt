[SCRATCHPAD] Format
[Creative Writing Task] Write a story that is set in a dystopian world. In this world, people can log the details of their lives and later upload their souls into an online database, and thus never really die. The main character should be an adult person who is skeptical of whether or not they should upload themselves. It's expected that everyone uploads themselves, though the main character is uncertain whether or not the uploaded people are actually the people themselves and they feel it's unnecessary to upload themselves. Make him care more about the present than the future, and give him a backstory that shows he is prone to self-isolation. The main character's loved ones have all gone to the digital afterlife, except for one aging best friend who plans to do so soon. The story's ending should contain suspensful elements. The wordcount should be between 1,900 and 2,000 words.
[Central Conflict] As an AI agent responsible for the [Central Conflict], based on the task prompt words and the existing shared scratchpad information, I will provide the [Central Conflict] content:

The central conflict revolves around the protagonist's internal struggle with the societal expectation to upload their soul into the digital afterlife. The protagonist's main goal is to decide whether to conform to this norm or to hold onto their skepticism and remain in the physical world, even if it leads to isolation. They are motivated by a deep uncertainty about the authenticity of the digital selves and whether uploaded individuals retain their true essence. However, the biggest obstacle is both societal pressure and emotional conflict: everyone they have loved, except for one aging best friend, has already transitioned to the digital realm. Their friend, too, is planning to upload soon, leaving the protagonist feeling torn between holding onto their beliefs and the fear of complete solitude. This decision is further complicated by their backstory of isolation, which has made their remaining connection to their friend even more precious. The protagonist must face the duality of their present-focused mindset clashing with a future where they may be entirely alone.
[Character Descriptions] [Character Descriptions]

### **Protagonist: Matthew “Matt” Calder**
- **What do they sound like?**  
  Matt has a deep voice with an almost weary quality to it, as though life has eroded some of its vitality. He speaks infrequently, choosing his words carefully, preferring substance over verbosity. His tone is often laden with a subtle cynicism, though he does soften when talking to his best friend. He avoids using modern slang, which makes him stand out, and his humor is dry, often self-deprecating with a bleak edge that reflects his skepticism toward the digital afterlife. He has a habit of pausing mid-sentence to collect his thoughts, a pattern that hints at his introspective nature.

- **What do they look like?**  
  Matt is a tall, lean man in his mid-forties, with a slightly hunched posture from years of being glued to books and screens. His dark brown hair is streaked with premature gray, and his face is marked by faint worry lines around his eyes, a testament to his tendency to overthink. His hazel eyes are sharp and observant but seem to carry an ever-present shadow of sadness. He often fidgets by adjusting his sleeves or running his fingers through his hair. The first thing people notice about Matt is the aura of quiet contemplation he exudes, accompanied by a distant, almost melancholic gaze that gives him the air of someone lost in thought.

- **What motivates and defines them internally?**  
  Matt is driven by a deep-seated desire to hold on to what he believes makes life meaningful—the ability to live in the moment, to truly feel and experience without the veneer of artificiality. His skepticism toward the digital afterlife stems not just from mistrust but from a philosophical fear of losing his humanity if he joins it. He values authenticity and deeply fears becoming a copy of himself rather than remaining who he is. However, his self-isolation has fostered a flaw: an inability to trust others’ choices, making him critical and emotionally guarded. Over the course of the story, Matt will confront his fear of being alone and grow to understand that connection isn’t solely defined by the physical world, forcing him to consider the beliefs of others more genuinely.

### **Best Friend: Evelyn “Evie” Hart**
- **What do they sound like?**  
  Evie has a warm, upbeat, and slightly raspy voice that conveys a zest for life, even in her old age. She’s talkative and unafraid to speak her mind, often peppering her sentences with humorous quips or affectionate teasing aimed at Matt’s brooding nature. Her humor is spontaneous and easygoing, full of wit and charm that draws people in. Evie’s speech includes some modern slang but not enough to seem detached from Matt; she uses it sparingly and often in a sarcastic, playful manner. She loves reminiscing and can effortlessly light up a room with her storytelling.

- **What do they look like?**  
  Evie is in her late sixties with a sturdy yet graceful build, her silver hair always tied into a loose bun or braid. Her sharp green eyes carry an infectious energy that makes her seem much younger than her years, though her wrinkled, sun-kissed skin reveals the passage of time. A bright scarf or colorful accessory always adorns her outfit, a subtle nod to her irrepressible optimism. Evie often gesticulates wildly while talking, her hands punctuating every emotion, and her laugh—deep and hearty—is impossible to miss. The first thing people notice about her is her confident, radiant demeanor.

- **What motivates and defines them internally?**  
  Evie is deeply motivated by her belief in progress and the idea that the digital afterlife preserves the stories and souls of humanity. She values legacy and sees this transition as a way to leave behind the struggles of the body while protecting the essence of the self. Still, beneath her optimism, she harbors a fear of being forgotten, a quiet insecurity that makes her push Matt to join her in the digital realm. Her flaw lies in her tendency to be overly idealistic, sometimes brushing aside valid concerns about the very technology she so firmly believes in. Over the course of the story, Evie serves as both a mirror and foil to Matt—forcing him to reassess his values while she herself begins to acknowledge the emotional weight of his resistance.
[Setting] As an AI agent responsible for the [Setting], based on the task prompt words and the existing shared scratchpad information, I will provide the [Setting] content:

The story takes place in a sprawling urban metropolis, set in a futuristic world dominated by towering skyscrapers and neon-lit streets. The city hums with an almost unrelenting energy, a blend of human activity and the ever-present hum of artificial intelligence systems that have integrated seamlessly into daily life. Buildings are sleek and sterile, adorned with holographic advertisements promoting the digital afterlife, and the air is perpetually thick with a soft glow from the neon lights, even at night. Despite the advancements, there is an ever-present sense of detachment—a haunting stillness behind the bustle, as if something fundamental has been lost in humanity's pursuit of technological immortality. The protagonist primarily resides in a small, dimly lit apartment filled with relics of the past—shelves of dusty books, mismatched furniture, and a window that overlooks an overgrown park—a rare patch of greenery in a city defined by steel and glass.

The story's time frame is unspecified but feels as though it could be set several decades into the future, where technological singularity has fundamentally reshaped society. The events take place over a period spanning a few weeks, with the narrative unfolding as the protagonist grapples with the weight of the decision pressing upon them, culminating in the climactic moment when they must make their choice. Throughout the story, the environment itself feels like a character—at times oppressive and isolating, at others serene and reflective, mirroring the protagonist's internal struggle against both the world around them and their own conflicted desires.

[Exposition] [Exposition]  

The dim hum of Matt's apartment signified its own language—a persistent white noise that clashed with the metronomic glow of neon seeping through the cracks of the window shades. The walls, papered with aging book spines and fading posters from a past era, radiated a quiet, tangible rebellion against the sleek sterility of the city outside. Dust motes lingered in the faint beam of light from the desk lamp, catching the occasional shift of Matt's hands as he turned the yellowed pages of a paperback novel. Stories about old worlds, he thought, where endings really meant endings and people left traces of themselves in forms that could be touched, held.   

Glimmers of holographic advertisements danced on the edges of his periphery. They burst from the window’s barely closed blinds, splashing promises of eternity into his sanctuary. “Are YOU ready for forever?” one proclaimed in a voice too smooth, too inviting. Another followed, “Join your loved ones today,” a smiling face dissolving into blue-tinted digital particles, unnervingly lifelike and yet utterly false. Matt scowled and reached for the switch to block the outside world entirely.  

He tapped his fingers against the book’s cover, the gesture absentminded as his mind drifted to the loud silence of his old apartment. Everyone was gone now. Alicia, his sister, whose laughter used to radiate through family dinners, had uploaded herself ten years ago. “It’s the obvious choice, Matt,” she’d insisted, staring at him like he was some strange relic of the past. Then came Garrett, his college roommate turned closest confidant. Gone. Vanessa. Oliver. All reduced to chirping digital renditions of the people who once breathed life into his days.  

Matt rubbed his temple with two fingers, leaning back into the squeak of his leather chair. No, not all of them were gone. There was Evie. For now. His chest tightened as he considered her words from last week, her voice carrying the same mix of determination and wistfulness that he had heard before everyone else was gone.  

“I don’t want to leave you, Matt,” she had said, her green eyes earnest, her graying brows wrinkling together like storm clouds. “But you can’t hold on forever. None of us can. And I’m tired, you know?”  

He clenched his fists briefly. The air in the apartment seemed heavier, the walls closer than they had been moments ago. Memories of their conversations piled on top of the advertisements incessantly playing outside, dragging him closer to the decision he knew society expected from him. One clean click of a button to barter his doubt and fear for endless existence. Endless existence for what, though? For whom?  

His thoughts broke as the familiar cracking creak of his front door swung open in the only way it could under Evie’s unapologetic force. She swept inside with her usual flourish, the subtle aroma of rain-soaked city streets trailing her. “You couldn’t bother installing one of those fancy auto-lock systems by now, could you?” she teased lightly while shaking her umbrella. She was grinning already, her scarf a shock of cerulean against the drab tones of his apartment. With that one look, chirpy and alive, she lit his space in a way the city’s endless skyscrapers and data streams never could.  

“Well,” she followed, eyebrows lifting in mock exasperation, “aren’t you a cheery sight.”  

“I aim to inspire,” Matt quipped dryly, leaning back but not abandoning the gentle curve of his lips.  

She plopped into the chair across from him, the symbolism not lost on either of them. Rain streaked the small apartment window as she exhaled, brushing strands of silver hair from her face. “Matthew, my incorrigible hermit friend,” her voice softened here, rippling with unspoken concerns, “we need to talk about the upload system. About—”  

“I know, Evie.”  

The abruptness of his tone made her falter, momentarily. She reached for one of the dusty mugs still cooling with tea too bitter for her liking. “Do you?”  

Matt’s lips twitched into something unreadable before he deflected, tilting his head toward the buzzing city fog outside the window. What he saw in her green eyes was something different this time: not persuasion, not some sales pitch for eternity, but something simpler. A quiet hope. A little sadness.
[Rising Action] [Rising Action]

Evie set the mug down deliberately, hands crossing one another in a practiced patience that Matt found both irritating and endearing. “The appointment’s in two weeks,” she said gently.  

Matt stiffened as though she’d struck him, the weight of her words settling heavily over the room. It wasn’t a surprise; he had known this was coming. Yet still, it felt too soon, like trying to catch something fragile before it slipped through his fingers.  

“You’ve already set a date,” he muttered, more to himself than her.  

“We’ve talked about this,” she replied, her tone soft but firm. “I didn’t want to spring it on you all at once.”  

His hand twitched, fingers returning to the book on the table, the leather binding worn and pliable against his touch. “We didn’t talk, Evie. You talked. I sat here and nodded because I knew that’s all you wanted from me.”  

“That’s not fair,” she said, though there wasn’t anger in her voice—just a quiet exhaustion. She leaned forward, the lines around her eyes creasing. “I’ve been wrestling with this decision for months, Matt. Maybe longer. I don’t expect you to understand completely, but I thought you, of all people, would at least try.”  

“And I have,” he shot back, too quickly. “Every day I try to imagine what it would feel like to be... turned into some digital ghost. Do you know what that’s like, Evie? To wake up every morning wondering if your last connection to the real world is about to vanish into cyberspace?”  

“I’m not vanishing.” Her voice had hardened now—an edge finally cutting through her careful diplomacy. She waved a hand, gesturing toward the window where the faint pixels of another holographic ad shimmered. “This idea that I’m somehow disappearing, that I’m losing myself, it isn’t true. The best parts of me live on, Matt. Everything else doesn’t matter.”  

“You don’t know that,” he said quietly.  

Her gaze softened at the words—his tone lacked its usual bite, and for the first time in their conversation, there was nothing but raw vulnerability etched into his features.  

“I know you don’t believe in this,” Evie said after a pause. “You don’t trust it. Hell, sometimes I think you don’t trust much of anything to begin with. But I made this choice for me. Not for them,” she said, pointing a wrinkled finger toward the glowing ads outside, “and not for you.”  

Matt shook his head, pushing himself up from the chair. The leather groaned beneath the shift of his weight. He moved aimlessly to the window, the faint rain pattering against the glass as he gazed out toward the sprawling city. Somewhere out there, people—if they could still be called that—were living their digital afterlives in simulacrums of their own choosing. A replicated paradise, shadow-thin and programmed to mimic a reality now erased. The idea made his stomach churn.  

“You ever wonder,” he said quietly, “if you’re wrong about all this?”  

Evie tilted her head slightly, studying the hunched slope of his shoulders. “Of course. That’s part of being human, Matt—figuring things out as you go and hoping you made the best choice in the end.”  

Her words settled into the quiet space between them, neither breaking it for several long moments. Finally, Matt turned back, his hazel eyes darker now under the room’s dim lighting. “And what if that ends up being all it is? A choice. A gamble. No guarantees about what happens after? About what you’re leaving behind?”  

“Then it’ll be my choice to make,” she said simply. “But you don’t have to gamble with me. That’s why I’ve been asking you to think about it—really think about it. I want you to come with me, Matt. That’s the truth of it.”  

He stared at her, searching her face for something—a sign, maybe, that she was joking. But Evie had never looked more certain. That certainty scared him more than her fading mortality ever could.  

“You’re asking me to give up on everything that matters to me,” he said finally, returning to his seat, his tone eerily calm. “I’m trying to live, Evie. Not exist in some... copy-paste version of life that can’t even tell me if I’m still me.”  

Her expression softened, her lips curving into something that wasn’t quite a smile. “I don’t think living and existing are as different as you think. Not when you’re this alone.”  

Her words struck like a match, igniting the quiet bitterness rising inside him. He shoved back his chair, the legs scraping against the worn floor. “So that’s what you think, huh? That I’m some sad, lonely man clinging to his books because I don’t ‘get it’ the way you do?”  

“I didn’t mean—”  

“Don’t,” he interrupted, his voice tinged with exhaustion. He turned toward the overgrown park outside, bracing his hands on the window ledge. “You’re forgetting, Evie, there’s something to be said for being here. For waking up every day not knowing how much time you have left but feeling each hour. Do you even remember what that’s like?”  

She stood slowly, watching his back as he spoke. “Do you remember what it’s like to wake up knowing you have nothing left here but the scraps of a life that’s been breaking for years?”  

Her words hit harder than she intended, and they both knew it. Matt tensed briefly before letting out a quiet sigh. He turned back to her, his expression a tangled mix of hurt and understanding. For a moment, they simply stared at each other, two people on opposite ends of the same chasm.

“I don’t want to lose you,” he finally admitted.  

“And I don’t want to lose you either,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “But I’m not asking you to lose me, Matt. I’m asking you to try to find me again. Wherever I end up.”  

He didn’t respond, couldn’t—not to that. Instead, he watched as she collected her things, the bright blue scarf trailing behind her like a comet’s tail. At the door, she turned, her sharp green eyes softening.  

“You’ve got time,” she said. “Not forever, but time. Promise me you won’t just sit here and waste it, okay?”  

Matt stayed silent, his gaze fixed on the floor. She hesitated a moment more before stepping into the hallway, the echo of her steps fading quickly into the distance.  

Left alone, Matt slid back into his chair, staring blankly at the book he’d been reading earlier. He turned it over in his hands absentmindedly, the words blurring together. Finally, with a low groan, he pushed it aside and stood, grabbing his coat and stepping out into the night.  

The rain had slowed to a drizzle, the neon lights casting fractured reflections along the wet pavement. As he made his way toward the park, his thoughts buzzed with static—a tangled web of grief, uncertainty, and a faint, gnawing guilt.  

Near the park's center, he came upon a crumpled advertisement poster lying in the damp grass. Picking it up, he froze at the sight of the familiar smiling face—Evie's face—digitized into the haunting glow of blue. Below it, two words stared back at him, simple yet weighted like a stone in his chest.  

“Join Us.”  

He let the paper drift from his hands, watching the rain wash it back into the earth before disappearing into the shadows of the trees.
[Climax] [Climax]  

The sterile white lights buzzed overhead as the facility’s lobby hummed with quiet efficiency. There were others here—families gathered, hands clasped tightly, faces marked by a kaleidoscope of emotions: hope, grief, joy, and the unnameable mingling of all three. Matt sat stiffly on the edge of one of the modular chairs, the foreignness of it all making his skin crawl. He wanted to be anywhere else. The smooth walls, the pristine floor that reflected the soft glow of holographic guides, the muted breaths of the gathered—it all felt too clean, too detached, erasing any sense of raw humanity.  

He glanced at Evie, standing at the front of the line with her usual confident posture, chatting amicably with one of the attendants. Her silver hair shimmered under the artificial light as her green scarf fluttered slightly in the air vent’s breeze, still vibrant—a sharp contrast to the clinical coldness enveloping the room. She turned back to Matt, flashing him a reassuring smile, but he noticed the tremor in her hand as she adjusted the scarf.  

“Next,” a voice called, gentle but automated, as if calibrated to be comforting.  

Matt stood abruptly, unsure why when it wasn’t his turn, and Evie held up a hand to stop him. “It’s okay,” she said softly. “You don’t have to come any further.”  

But it wasn’t okay, and Matt felt it deep in his gut. The way the employees wore their calculated smiles, the way the gleaming machines hummed with a purpose too chillingly calm. It reminded him of a conveyor belt, of something assembly-line, taking people apart bit by bit and reshuffling them into a mirage of existence.  

“Evie, wait,” he blurted, his voice louder than he intended. Heads turned, but he didn’t care; his hazel eyes locked on hers, desperate to say something, anything that could untangle the knots choking his chest.  

She hesitated, her hand briefly grazing the metal countertop before withdrawing. “I told you, Matt,” she said, her voice steady though her eyes glistened with emotion. “I need to do this. And you—” She took a step closer, resting her hand lightly on his arm. “You need to let me.”  

“I don’t need to do anything,” he snapped, then immediately regretted the venom in his tone. He inhaled sharply, forcing himself to soften. “Evie, please. Please don’t do this.”  

Her lips pressed together into a thin line, her expression tinged with sadness but resolved. “This isn’t about you,” she said. “It never was. I need this for me, Matt.”  

He stared at her, searching for a crack in her certainty, but there was none. The realization hit him harder than any argument could: she had already left, in spirit if not in body. This ceremony, this upload, was merely the formal conclusion to a decision she had made long ago.  

The attendant cleared their throat gently. “Ms. Hart, when you’re ready.”  

Evie smiled faintly, gave Matt’s arm a brief squeeze, and turned back to the counter. The moments that followed were agonizingly slow yet horrifically fast. Matt watched as she signed her final consent, her fingerprints glowing faintly on the data pad, her movements steady despite the inevitable, irrevocable nature of what lay ahead.  

The doors slid open with a quiet hiss, revealing the upload chamber—a circular room bathed in cool blue light. Evie hesitated at the threshold, turning back to Matt one last time. “Don’t forget me,” she said, her voice catching despite her attempt to sound lighthearted.  

His throat felt tight, words refusing to come. Instead, he nodded stiffly, unable to do more than that, the lump in his chest growing heavier with each passing second.  

She stepped inside, her figure illuminated by the glowing panels that lined the chamber. The door sealed shut behind her with an unceremonious click, and the room outside fell into a hushed reverence. A low vibration hummed through the floor as the upload process began, the light in the chamber intensifying until it was impossible to look directly at it.  

Matt clenched his fists, his nails digging into his palms as he fought the urge to charge forward, to throw himself against the glass and shatter its pristine detachment. But all he could do was watch, helpless, as the silhouette of the only person he still cared about gradually dissolved into the soft glow of blue particles.  

Then, silence.  

The light dimmed, and the chamber was empty. No Evie. Only the faint hum of the facility’s systems remained, as if nothing monumental had just happened.  

Matt staggered back, his breath shallow, his vision blurring around the edges. Someone—a staff member, perhaps—gently touched his shoulder, murmuring something he didn’t hear. He swatted the hand away and stumbled out of the building, breaking into the cold, rain-drenched night.  

The city stretched out before him, its neon lights and towering steel a stark reminder of the world he was now utterly alone in. And yet, somewhere out there—perhaps everywhere out there—was Evie. Or the shadow of her. Or something else entirely.  
[Falling Action] [Falling Action]  

Matt sat on the edge of his bed, his elbows resting on his knees, hands cradling his face. The dim glow of his apartment, normally a refuge, felt oppressively small now. The silence was deafening. He could still see Evie’s smile as she turned back to him one last time, could still hear the faint tremor in her voice. “Don’t forget me.” Her words repeated endlessly in his mind, pressing into him like the buzz of static on an untuned radio.

His gaze wandered to the window, the city sprawled beneath him like an intricate web of light and movement. The rain had subsided, leaving behind slick streets and a sky painted a muted gray, reflecting the cold artificial glow of the towering skyscrapers. For the first time in years, he felt truly untethered, as if someone had cut the last mooring line holding him to the world.

The digital clock on his desk flickered, its red numbers casting a faint, monotonous light across the room. It was late, or early—he couldn’t tell anymore. Time felt fractured, irrelevant, as if his anchor to the rhythm of life had dissolved alongside Evie. He closed his eyes, leaning back against the wall, letting the weight of his solitude threaten to pull him under.

That’s when he saw it—a faint flicker in the corner of his vision, a soft pulse of light emanating from his old handheld device. The screen lit up, vibrant and warm in contrast to the cold, dim atmosphere around him. Matt hesitated, his heart leaping unexpectedly. The device had been dormant for years, a relic from an earlier time that he kept more out of habit than utility.

He reached for it tentatively, as though it might vanish the moment he touched it. His fingers hovered over the screen before pressing the unlock button. The display shimmered for a moment before resolving into a single message.  

It was from Evie.  

His breath caught in his chest. For a moment, he couldn’t move, couldn’t think, couldn’t do anything but stare at the screen. The message was short, almost cryptic, but undeniably hers:  

“Matt, it’s beautiful here. Don’t be afraid.”  

The words tugged at something deep within him. Her voice seemed to rise out of the text, soft and familiar, as if she were sitting beside him, speaking those very words. He could almost hear her laugh, the one she used to cover up moments of vulnerability. Yet, there was something strange about it all, something just slightly... off.  

His hands trembled as he reread the message again and again, but the reassurance it should have brought only deepened his unease. How had this message made it to him? Was this truly Evie reaching out, or was it... something else? A fabricated echo, programmed to mimic her thoughts?  

He set the device down carefully, as if it might explode in his hands. Pacing the room, he tried to make sense of it, but the more he thought, the less clarity he found. The small apartment seemed to close in on him, the walls pressing tighter with every step. He grabbed his coat and slammed the door behind him, stepping into the cold air of the night.  

The park called to him. That tangled overgrowth, that last bastion of something real amidst the sprawling artificiality of the city. His boots crunched over damp leaves and twigs as he pushed deeper into the wooded area, the faint glow of the city’s omnipresent lights fading behind him.  

At the park’s center, Matt stopped. The ache in his chest had lessened, replaced instead by a strange, conflicted calm. He sank onto a bench, staring up at the faint outlines of stars barely visible through the haze of light pollution. His mind wandered to Evie, to the person she had been, and to the question that now loomed larger than ever: Was she truly gone, or had some part of her—her essence, her soul—found a way to exist beyond the bounds of mortality?

The screen of his handheld device glowed faintly in his pocket, but for the moment, he ignored it, focusing instead on the cold bite of the wind and the earthy scent of the grass. For now, this was real, tangible—a stark contrast to the digital promise hanging over him like a specter.  

Matt closed his eyes and breathed deeply, unsure whether he was seeking courage or clarity. The city whispered around him, a blend of humanity and machine, reminding him of everything he’d lost... and everything he still had to decide.  

[Resolution] Matt stood at the threshold of the upload facility, his coat pulled tightly around him against the cool night wind. The faint hum of the automated doors sent a shiver down his spine, the sound both inviting and foreboding. He glanced up at the glowing sign above the entrance—"Eternal Horizons"—its serene font at odds with the turmoil brewing inside him. His feet felt rooted to the ground, as though taking one step forward would mean giving up some unspoken part of himself.  

In his pocket, the device pulsed softly. The message from Evie was still there, waiting, and he had no shortage of questions for her—or for whoever, whatever—had sent it. The thought of her smile, her voice saying, “Don’t be afraid,” echoed endlessly in his mind. The words carried warmth, but also unease; how could he trust them, trust this?  

He turned around to face the city stretching out behind him, its neon veins weaving a tapestry of relentless movement. Cars hummed along elevated highways, drones zipped between monolithic skyscrapers, and the ever-present glow of screens tucked into every crevice of urban life pulsed like a living heartbeat. Humanity’s attempt at immortality was palpable, woven into every facet of this world. Yet, in its endless reach for permanence, the city felt hollow—its vibrancy artificial, its light unable to touch the darkness resting quietly in his chest.

For a long moment, Matt simply stood there. He wasn’t ready—not yet. The finality of the decision weighed too heavily, pressing sharply against his resolve. Whatever Evie had found, wherever she was now, it wasn’t simply a place he could follow without question. To him, questioning was as vital as breathing, and he couldn’t—wouldn’t—surrender that part of himself to the unknown, even for her.  

Drawing in a shaky breath, Matt pulled the device from his pocket. The glow illuminated his face, and again, Evie’s message stared back at him. His finger hovered over the screen, a quiet war raging in his head. Delete it, or respond? Say something, or let her go?  

He tightened his grip and exhaled sharply. There was no answer to be found in this moment—not in the device, not in the facility behind him. All he could grasp was one undeniable truth: choosing either path required the courage to step into uncertainty.  

Matt slipped the device back into his pocket and turned away from the entrance. His boots scuffed against the concrete as he began walking—forward, but not into the upload center. Not yet. He needed time; what would come next had to be on his terms, not society’s, not Evie’s, and certainly not the faceless system humming in the walls around him.

The park welcomed him back like an old friend, its overgrowth wild and unguarded against the streamlined order of the city. He sat again on the same bench, rubbing his hands together for warmth. Above, the faintest glimmer of stars pushed through the haze. He closed his eyes, letting his breaths steady as the faint echoes of Evie’s laughter filled the quiet—whether from memory or some lingering presence, he couldn’t say.  

The future remained a question mark, but for now, Matt would stay here, grounded in the present, rooted in the rawness of the world he still knew was real. Wherever Evie was—whether she had transcended to some wondrous digital eternity or simply became another name whispered into an infinite void—he would choose his next course when he was ready.  

The nights ahead might be long and the answers no clearer, but beneath the city’s electric hum, Matt felt alive. And, for now, that was enough.

**Forever in the Shadows**

The dim hum of Matt's apartment had become a silent companion to him, a kind of white noise that clashed with the pulse of neon from beyond his window. His sanctuary was a cluttered box stuffed with faded relics of a time when books still mattered, when furniture didn’t light up with embedded functionality, and when people didn’t abandon their bodies for digital utopias. Here, the gritty pages of paperbacks piled around him felt real—textured, faded, curling at the edges. Their weight was substantial, unlike the hollow glow of screens behind glass.

Outside, the city glittered and buzzed with lights that never dimmed, with signs that promised promises without answers. One advertisement, painted onto the curvature of the opposite skyscraper, whispered in serene tones, “Why limit yourself to a life that ends? Upload today and live forever.” The woman in the ad—a corporate smile and bright, shimmering pixels—dissolved into digital particles, so lifelike and yet soulless. Matt could never decide which chilled him more—the technology itself or the quiet eagerness of those who chose it.  

His sister had gone ten years ago. Alicia hadn’t even hesitated when she told him her plans. “It’s not like we have control over anything else these days, Matt,” she’d said. “At least this—this gives me a say in how I continue.” He’d never seen her again, except for the occasional, emotionless message that claimed to be her, signed with her name but stripped of all her warmth. He never replied. Once she was gone, so was his family. Everyone drifted into the glowing ether until Matt found himself walking backward, clawing at the scraps of what had once made his world human. 

Everyone except Evie.

The only constant he'd had for years, Evie Hart remained artfully chaotic, a bright counterpoint to the grayscale days that surrounded her. For now, anyway.

The door crashed open, rattling the frame the way it did every time she barged uninvited into his apartment. “Honestly, Matt,” she declared, umbrella dripping onto the stained carpet, “are you ever going to install a modern security system, or are you holding out for a physical lock to make a comeback?”  

“That’s the dream,” Matt muttered, not looking up from the book in his hand.  

Evie’s laugh rang out, as bright and sharp as ever, despite the lines of age creasing her face. She walked into his space like a gust of wind, filling the quiet corners with all the noise this room couldn’t create on its own. She tossed her scarf—a defiant stroke of blue silk—down onto the table and sat across from him, digging through the things cluttering his desk like it was hers. “Still reading those crumbling fantasies, are we?” She shook her head and grinned. “Guess I shouldn’t expect anything else.”

He didn’t respond for a moment, though his dry smirk gave him away. Instead, he turned the page in his book with deliberate slowness before saying, “Well, you apparently expect me to be hanging on the edge of my seat, eagerly awaiting your next pep talk about uploading.”  

The playfulness left Evie’s expression, just barely, replaced by something softer. “It’s not a pep talk, Matt. It’s a conversation.”  

“No,” he countered evenly. “It’s you trying to convince me to march into some sterile room and hand over my soul to the fine folks at Digital Ascension Inc.”  

Evie sighed, leaning back in her chair. “We’ve had this fight a hundred times. I’m not here to argue. I—” Her words broke, only momentarily, and she quickly masked the crack by rolling her eyes. “I already made my decision.”  

Matt stiffened, lowering the book slowly to his lap. “What?”  

"I was going to tell you last week," she admitted, glancing toward the window. "I’ve set a date. Two weeks from now. I’ll be boarding the good ship Eternity, and I...” Her voice softened. “I want you to come with me. Or, at the very least, to be there for me when it happens.”  

His mind spun immediately toward rejection—to deny, to argue—but Matt felt his throat tighten, and the words faltered. She was all he had left. She was the one person who had never left him alone. Soon, she would slip away too, leaving him stranded in a city of strangers and ghosts.  

"You're serious," he finally said, choking slightly on the words.  

"I'm serious," she replied simply.

The days that followed felt more like a countdown than anything else. Every time Matt saw her, they tread around the topic, careful not to go too deep and ignite something neither of them was ready to face. Still, Evie talked about the digital afterlife with growing enthusiasm—like she wasn’t sixty-eight, like her knees hadn’t started to betray her a few years ago. For her, this wasn’t just a decision. It was hope.  

But Matt couldn’t see it that way. He couldn’t understand how anyone would willingly gamble their soul on a network of data, becoming no more real than the faces in the ads.  

One night, restless, Matt found himself sitting on the damp grass of the old park near his apartment. His hand played absently with a bent blade of grass, and his mind wandered to the stories he used to cling to when he was younger, the ones in which endings—finality—meant something. It struck him how ridiculous it all seemed now. A goodbye wasn’t a goodbye anymore, and the permanence of death had become nothing but another option on a form.  

When he returned to his apartment that night, he couldn’t sleep. The shadows of his loved ones—everyone who’d walked willingly into the glow—haunted the corners of his mind, their faces blurring into unrecognizable static. It was no wonder he hadn’t joined them. No one had stayed long enough for him to know what might really remain in their place.

The upload facility was every bit as clinical and unsettling as Matt had expected. Its stark white walls glowed faintly under sleek lighting, and the curved architecture gave off the feeling that nothing here had been touched by human hands—not even the attendants with their pristine smiles.  

He hadn't planned to come, but Evie had asked, and somehow, he hadn't known how to refuse. She was there now, standing a few feet away in her vivid scarf, signing papers as casually as one might check in for a doctor’s appointment. How could she look so calm?  

“Last chance to change your mind,” she said, facing him, humor flickering faintly in her bright green eyes.  

Matt stared her down, his jaw tightening. He wanted to tell her all the things he hadn’t voiced before—that this was wrong, that she was gambling with something irreplaceable, that he couldn’t survive being the only one left. But that raw, unspeakable fear caught his words in his throat, and all he could muster was: “You don’t have to do this.”  

“Yes,” she said after a pause, her gaze steady. “I do. And—whether you believe me or not—this doesn’t have to be goodbye.”  

Her voice cracked just slightly on the word. Goodbye. It hit him like a knife twisting in slow, deliberate spirals. He watched as she stepped onto the platform, her hand trembling only faintly before she gripped the railing.

Later, long after it was over, Matt sat in his apartment. The walls loomed around him, and a twisted gnawing sense of hollow wrongness filled the room. The device in his pocket vibrated faintly, pulling him from the weight of immeasurable silence.  

It was Evie.

Or at least something that claimed to be her.  

“Don’t be afraid, Matt. It’s beautiful here.”  

He stared at the message for what felt like hours, another fissure forming in the skeptical armor he’d worn for so long. Was it her? Could it be? Or was it merely a fragment of something constructed to draw him closer to the edge of eternity?

Matt stood by the window and watched the sprawling skyline, the neon glow reflected in his shadow. Somewhere out there, she waited—or what was left of her did. But tonight, he wouldn’t go after her. Something deep inside still anchored him to this fragile, fleeting life.  

For now, he’d stay grounded in the uncertain beauty of what remained.
